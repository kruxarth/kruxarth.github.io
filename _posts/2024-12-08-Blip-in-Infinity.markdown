"Blip in infinity." It’s a phrase that’s been sitting in my Instagram bio for a while now (and if you’re reading this from the future, who knows, maybe I’ve moved on to something even cheesier). But those three words mean a lot to me. At first glance, they might seem like just another artsy statement. But to me, they reflect a perspective that shapes how I see the world—and my place in it.

Let’s zoom out for a second. The universe is 13.8 billion years old. Earth, our tiny blue dot, has existed for 4.5 billion years. Humans? We’ve been here for a laughable 200,000 years. And civilization as we know it began only 10,000 years ago. Compared to the grand timeline of the cosmos, we are barely a blink.

Now, think about your own existence. The odds of you being here are so staggeringly small that they’re hard to comprehend. For generations, the right people had to meet, and yes, the right people had to have sex at the right time—century after century—just so you could exist. Consciousness, the ability to experience life, is an extraordinary gift.

But here’s where things get interesting: Does this make you feel special? Or does it remind you of how insignificant you are?

Sure, if you’re healthy and lucky, you might live to see 100 years—a milestone most of us from the 21st century might achieve, especially with advancements in technology. But even 100 years is nothing compared to the age of the universe. In the larger scheme of things, you and I are just tiny, fleeting blips in an infinite expanse of time and space.

And here’s the liberating truth: That’s okay.

Your mistakes, embarrassments, failures, and fears—all those moments that keep you awake at night—will one day be irrelevant. One day, the universe will erase every record of what you did or didn’t do. That’s not a depressing thought; it’s freedom. It means you’re free to live your life however you want. You’re free to take risks, to be weird, to make mistakes, and to go after what makes you happy.

For me, blip in infinity is a reminder to live unapologetically. I’m here for a fleeting moment, and I don’t have to spend that moment obsessing over perfection or trying to control everything. My happiness, my experiences, and my growth are enough.

Now, here’s the twist. As I write this at the end of 2024, I realize I’m a bit of a walking contradiction. While I love the freedom that comes from knowing nothing matters in the long run, I’ve also been thinking about legacy. I want to leave something behind—not necessarily to be remembered forever, but to know that I made an impact while I was here.

And, okay, I’ll admit it: I’m also obsessed with the idea of immortality. Maybe it’s naïve, but with how fast science is progressing, I genuinely hope humanity can extend life well beyond the arbitrary 100-year mark. I’ve spent much of this year focused on fitness, partly because I want to be around long enough to see what the future holds. Whether it’s multi-planetary life or breakthroughs in longevity, I want to be there—not just a spectator, but a participant.

So, while I embrace my insignificance, I also hold on to the hope of being part of something bigger. After all, being a blip doesn’t mean you can’t burn brightly while you’re here.

Here’s to 2024—a year of contradictions, reflections, and dreams as infinite as the universe itself.
