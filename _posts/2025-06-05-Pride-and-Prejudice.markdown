Book Review: Pride and Prejudice

Okay, so the first two paragraphs are not about the book, so you can skip them if you want to get straight to the review. But honestly, I doubt anyone reading this is that eager for the book review that they’d skip these parts. Still, just had to get that disclaimer out. Also, maybe there are minor spoilers, but no one reading this is probably going to pick up the book after reading this anyway.

So, my first year of college ended and it felt like time passed by really quickly. I did think of writing about how I was feeling, but I wasn’t feeling very strongly or very positively. There are things I wish I had done differently. I felt like I didn’t push myself enough. Anyway, we can talk about that another time. I’m hoping to get more regular with publishing here. I want to show more of myself online and offline. I think I’m very reserved, and that’s holding me back from really living. I want to be more expressive and just deal with whatever comes from that. Now let’s get to the book review, shall we? :)

I thought the plot was really simple. The story follows Elizabeth, a sharp and strong-willed protagonist. She’s opinionated, quick-witted, and independent in a time when women were expected to stay quiet, look pretty, and marry rich. The irony is that she ends up doing exactly that. But to be fair, she wasn’t actively trying to.

She’s from a well-off family, part of the gentry class. Her future husband, Darcy, is from the aristocracy. He’s the main romantic lead in the story. Darcy represents pride, and Elizabeth represents prejudice, especially at the beginning. The story flows smoothly and the pacing feels natural. You never get the sense that events are being rushed or forced.

What I really enjoyed was how the characters were sarcastic or passive-aggressive in the most polite ways. They insult each other without ever breaking the social rules of the time. Elizabeth’s interactions with her cousin stood out to me—they were ridiculous and entertaining in the best way.

I started reading it in EPUB format but later switched to the audiobook version (it’s on YouTube). It became my go-to book for afternoon naps. Not because it was boring, but because the narration was calm and easy to drift off to. I think I managed not to spoil too much, so if you’re thinking of reading it, you still can. Let me know if you have, or if you end up doing it after this.
