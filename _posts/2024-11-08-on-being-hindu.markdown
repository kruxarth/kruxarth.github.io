title: "On being Hindu"

Recently, I was trying to gather my thoughts on what my religious views were, so I thought, what better way than to write it down and turn it into an article? I haven’t been publishing as much as I would have liked, and my previous blog didn’t receive the meaningful response I was hoping for. Now, with more Instagram followers, I’m hopeful this one will reach a larger audience and find more people interested in similar ideas. It’s going to be a long read, so buckle up.

In 2020 and 2021, I spent a lot of time thinking about religion and came to the conclusion that there was no God. I wasn’t just an atheist; I had become an anti-theist. Thankfully, it was just a phase, one that I now consider valuable to have gone through. If you ask me today, I would confidently say I identify as a Hindu, though my understanding of what it means to be Hindu has evolved and will likely keep evolving throughout my life.

In Hindu dharma, as well as in other dharmic religions, the ideas of rebirth and karma are central. Schools of thought rejecting these ideas have existed within the Indian subcontinent, but they don't have a major influence in today’s discourse, so I won’t delve into them here.

I don’t personally believe in rebirth or karma—not because I’ve actively decided to reject them, but because I haven’t found compelling reasons to believe in them. In fact, I think there’s an argument to be made, however unconventional it may sound, about the potential dangers of these concepts.

Let me explain. I’ll be addressing the layman’s understanding of rebirth and karma, which is what the majority of followers of dharmic religions believe in. A person might argue that people born into poverty or unfortunate circumstances are suffering as a result of sins committed in a previous life. The same argument could be extended for others who maybe going through difficult situations in their life temporarily. 

Now, people who truly subscribe to this idea are cruel and inhumane, regardless of their religious affiliation. Had they been raised with different values, they might still find ways to justify this mindset. I know that most Hindus and followers of dharmic religions aren’t bad people; when they see someone suffering, they don’t immediately think the person deserves it because of “bad karma.” Still, one can’t help but notice that those who do think this way are being logically consistent within that framework.

For most people who believe in karma and rebirth, these beliefs bring a sense of stability and purpose to life, and I respect that. I would have liked that stability too, but I can’t force myself to believe in ideas I am not convinced of just for peace of mind.

Next is the idea of an omnipresent creator watching over us constantly. I am open to the possibility of a higher being or “creator” who exists beyond our understanding of the universe. For all I know, it could be a single entity or multiple ones. (Or perhaps Earth itself, our home, could be a biology project of this entity, much like a petri dish in an experiment.) To me, the universe is so vast and ancient that the notion of someone watching over every action of humanity seems unlikely. Even if I’m wrong, I feel that such a creator would be non-interfering.

I considered discussing hell and heaven, but I think my views on them are clear by now. Besides, these concepts aren’t as central to dharmic religions as they are in Christianity and Islam. Not all Hindus believe in them, and even those who do often view them as temporary states (this is, anecdotally, the majority opinion).

So, why do I call myself Hindu? I believe my religion is a conglomerate of ideas. While rebirth and karma are central and widely accepted by most Hindus, I don’t believe all Hindus are required to accept these ideas. Hinduism is a diverse religion; it’s not a polytheist religion. There’s space within it for monotheism, polytheism, henotheism, pantheism, and panentheism. Now many of you reading this aren’t probably familiar with the last three terms even if you are very likely familiar with those ideas itself. Here is a brief explanation:


- **Henotheism**: The worship of a single, supreme god that doesn’t deny the existence of other deities that might also be worshipped.

- **Pantheism**: The doctrine that the universe, conceived as a whole, is God, and there’s no God apart from the combined substance, forces, and laws manifest in the universe (a non-dualistic view).

- **Panentheism**: The belief that the divine intersects every part of the universe and also extends beyond space and time (a dualistic view).


The last two concepts are central to many Hindu schools of thought throughout history. I believe my religion encourages independent thinking, and it’s okay to have different answers. My disbelief in rebirth and karma is, in fact, a product of faithfully thinking critically. I’m open to changing my beliefs and might come to appreciate or be convinced of these ideas. This isn’t a matter of being right or wrong; it’s about self-discovery and finding inner peace.

So, what does being Hindu mean to me? To me, it’s about being open to other (tolerant) ideologies and viewpoints. It’s about maximizing well-being for as many people as possible, but nor  at the cost of harming others. It’s about being open to the possibility of a higher entity I don’t yet understand and perhaps being connected to it in some way.

There’s much more I want to discuss: my opinions on Vedanta, the Ramayana & Mahabharata, Abrahamic religions, and casteism & varna. However, including them here would make this article longer than I’d like, and it would diverge from the topic. I’ll cover these in upcoming articles. Please share your thoughts in the comments, or feel free to DM me if you’d like to discuss further!
