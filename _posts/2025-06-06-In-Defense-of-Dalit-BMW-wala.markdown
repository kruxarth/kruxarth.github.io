Well, when I had decided to start writing blogs, I had told myself I’m not gonna write anything controversial. Let my blogs be about things that interest me — books, ideas, philosophy. Yet here we are. I don’t know why exactly. A good friend of mine had asked me a few days ago to explain my pro-SC/ST reservation stance. I did not feel like explaining it to him that particular day. He had asked in very good faith. So this blog is for him and people who want to engage in this discussion of a polarising and controversial topic.

I think the avg Upper Caste person is not interested in that. And I do not write this to "convert" them so to speak. They are unfortunately living in a completely different world with their own alternate history. It is very sad that they take pride in their caste identities which were based on oppression of those from marginalised communities. It is neither necessary nor fruitful to engage with them. I think the caste system was an unfortunate chapter in our civilization. A blot. To be a true Indian who believes in the principles of our Constitution and Preamble, we must seek to actively dismantle it.

Now that I have calmed down a bit, I guess we can start.

1) Reservation affects merit of less people than you think

Okay, the smart ones among you probably figured out what I’m trying to get at. And yeah, it is not a strong argument, yet I think it is a crucial one. Let me use the example of NEET 2024 to make my case.

We have some 50k govt medical MBBS seats in India. That comes out to around a 2.5% selection rate. We must consider here that OBC reservation, which is 27% nationally, has cutoffs only slightly below or very similar to general cutoffs. And then there’s the fact that most upper caste students are eligible for EWS reservation. So SC/ST reservation, which has significant difference, accounts for 22.5%.

Let me borrow some data from NEET 2024:

GEN – 652 – 25K

OBC – 652 – 25K

EWS – 647 – 28K

SC – 550 – 137K

ST – 526 – 168K


To obtain a rank over 50K in NEET you would have required a score of 625+. In a hypothetical world where reservation did not exist and all the 2.5% seats were unreserved, you would still have not made it if you scored below 625, which is also very difficult to achieve.

The OBC/EWS/GEN students who scored between 650–625 truly suffered. Had there been no reservation, they would have made it. But if you step back and think about it, that’s some 25k people. But there are many who scored much below that from non-SC/ST categories who pretend as if reservation had a negative impact on their lives when it did not.

True, their rich, BMW-owning, ALLEN-Kota SC/ST friend made it with a much lower score — but that does not mean they lost something they would have otherwise gotten. Okay, I know this sounds like a bad argument, but you need to understand that a lot of people who scream and are the loudest critics of SC/ST reservation, blaming it for all their problems, wouldn’t have made it anyways.

And that’s not because they are dumb or didn’t work hard. It is brutal. The competition is absolutely brutal. So many random factors — like the question paper set you receive, or what you had been reading the days prior to exam — can make the difference between 625 and 652. Both are deserving and intelligent students.

Now I will repeat what we all already know: we need more seats. We need to force our governments to make it a priority to create more high-quality education seats — and not blame SC/ST people for that.

2) Why Reservation

Okay. Now. Of course, I have not written this blog to argue with the consciousness of people who believe in caste supremacy or that caste system was a virtuous mechanism. I do not know who is reading this, or when, how many years down the line. But at the current point in my life, I am surrounded by people who believe this — and quite proudly at that.

To me this is very shocking, as it would be to some of the readers. But that is how it is.

We know that in India, we practised strict endogamy for at least the last 2000 years. During this time, there had been a very systemic effort to remove Dalits from the mainstream. The chaturvarna system had four varnas:

Brahmins – Nothing to explain here

Kshatriyas – Warrior classes, modern-day Rajputs/Marathas (depending on state)

Vaishyas – Trader class

Shudras – Modern-day OBC people


Dalits do not appear in this system because they were ati shudras/avarnas (those without varna). They lay outside this system. My point is: this othering of these communities was practised for centuries. When we got independence, it was necessary that they be integrated with society.

And why is it good to integrate them?

Thing is — if a section of your country is disenfranchised, sidelined, and feels like they own nothing or have nothing to do with the country, then your country is sooner or later going to be doomed. You’re going to experience civil war when the marginalised ones feel like they have nothing to lose if all of it burns to the ground. And they wouldn’t even be wrong.

This is not to say that’s what would’ve happened in India. My point is more general — a matter of reason and logic.

It’s one thing if some people are underrepresented in one area of public life or the other. But what happened with Dalits in India was a denial of public spaces, dignity, education. It wouldn’t have healed on its own — not at the rate it is happening (which it is). I will carry this argument into the next point.

3) Reservation is not a poverty alleviation scheme

The point of reservation is distribution of power, of resources, among all communities. While it is going to be a reality that some communities will dominate in some business owing to their tight-knit network, or some states will dominate one particular sport perhaps due to culture — national resources like education seats in govt institutions, or govt jobs, or political offices themselves — all of these things are national resources.

Reservation isn’t meant to be a cure for poverty — though fixing the issue of poverty is just as crucial. I think poverty is a very multidimensional issue and there are different types of poverty that require different kinds of solutions.

For the kid of the mother begging at traffic signals — for both of them, going to IIT is not something they dream of. That’s the sad reality. I am not going to go into how poverty could be fixed, as that’s not what this blog is about (though I do have a fair bit of opinion, having read a few books about the same).

Here, I would agree with anti-caste-reservation people — why must government subsidise the education of lower caste people who are rich? I think college fees should always be need-based over blanket waivers for gender/caste.

The BMW Dalit Wala

We now are at the part referenced in the title of the blog post. Time to wrap up.

Every upper caste person has a Dalit friend who owns multiple properties, is well off, with multiple expensive cars. I do not intend to strawman my opponents here by pretending to create an imaginary caricature. Rich Dalits are very much real, and they do continue to “rip off” the benefits of reservation — in the words of my anti-reservation friends.

But step back and think about it.

Does the existence of these people show reservation is a failure — or that it’s working?

I’d argue that we have so many rich Dalits that almost every UC person knows one. That’s evidence of reservation working. This would have been unimaginable in 1947! Dalit grooms have literally been murdered for mounting a horse on their own wedding (unfortunately, these incidents still continue in some villages — though they are less common now. It is still shameful that they happen at all in the 21st century).

Now, as to whether rich Dalits should continue to get reservation — that’s an interesting debate. A lot of good-faith people from upper caste backgrounds who are not casteist strongly believe that reservation was a good idea — but now it’s just a few old families using it for generations, preventing the actual needy from benefiting.

I think it should be noted that as a caste group, upper caste people own half the country’s wealth, and SC/ST own about half their population. This does not take away the lived experience of a poor upper caste child. What is it to him that his kin owns half the wealth?

The point I am making is: you are, in all likelihood, overestimating how many rich Dalit people exist.

Now, should there be a creamy layer for them?

Well, let’s backtrack a little. We went through how NEET 2024 cutoff for OBC and Gen was the same — higher than EWS. The OBC reservation has a creamy layer cap of ₹8L/annum. But let’s not kid ourselves — we all know how easy it is to fake it.

Likewise, it would be difficult to implement and enforce such a creamy layer exclusion.

So just because some people will find loopholes, should we not have any rules?

If that’s what you thought, I think you should pat yourself on the back — because that’s exactly the right way to think critically. Just because people will break rules is no reason to not have rules.

Now imagine what would have happened to the OBC cutoff if we could somehow enforce the creamy layer strictly and make it something like ₹2L. I think I don’t need to explain — it is obvious that the OBC cutoff would have fallen.

Why? Because then it would be composed of real poor people who couldn’t get good resources, had no relatives who ever cracked NEET, poor nutrition, growing up in households where parents constantly fight over money.

It’s a tradeoff. I don’t think a creamy layer for SC/ST is an objectively good or bad idea.

If you are someone who thinks OBC cutoff being similar to Gen is a good thing — as it means OBC reservation becomes kinda pointless and OBC kids will need to be just as “meritorious” — then that’s a valid opinion. In fact, in your logic, it is good that many OBC get a fake income certificate despite having incomes higher than ₹8L — as they are effectively making OBC reservation more competitive.

What will happen if we introduce SC/ST creamy layer and enforce it strictly? The already low cutoffs will fall further.

And a child from completely rural background who has a low score gets in vs another kid of same lower caste who was richer and got better score — as elitist as it may sound to some — the second kid has a better chance of making the most of the opportunity.

I think a much better argument can be made for reservation within sub-categorization of SC/ST — something the Supreme Court agreed to. I don’t know if it’s politically viable, but the dominant castes within SC/ST have dominated, and they have a sense of superiority among them.

That’s why caste census is important. I think more data will give us a clearer picture.

The Reservation End Game

So when will reservation end?

Continuing from where we left off — if we are to not introduce SC/ST creamy layer, or even if we do and it is implemented the same way as OBC, the cutoffs will keep rising year on year. That’s been happening for decades. The competition within SC/ST category is increasing.

I think there will come a point in the future where reservation will become meaningless. I think I would have preferred that someday, when SC/ST representation improved in all sectors, a committee is formed which would declare that reservation has achieved its purpose.

But I am too much of a realist to believe that’ll happen. Their politicians would never let that happen. It would be electoral suicide for any party to argue that.

SC/ST reservation becoming meaningless automatically is the best we can hope for.
