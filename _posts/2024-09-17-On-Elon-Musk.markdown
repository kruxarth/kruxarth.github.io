Elon Musk, the world’s richest man and often compared to Iron Man from the Avengers, is one of the most influential and controversial figures of our time. In the race for the most influential person of the 21st century, Elon is undoubtedly a leading contender. (For context, Albert Einstein held that honor for the 20th century.) Recently, I finished reading his biography by Walter Isaacson, which was released in September 2023. I want this post to serve as a time capsule of my opinions, which may evolve in the future.

So, where do we begin? Even before reading the book, I considered myself a bit of an Elon fanboy. I’d regularly check his Twitter account, fascinated by his unfiltered communication style. While I still hold a generally favorable opinion of the man, my view has become more nuanced, acknowledging his strengths as well as his flaws.

Elon Musk currently leads several groundbreaking companies:

- **Tesla**: An electric car company also working on self-driving cars and humanoid robots called Optimus.
- **SpaceX**: A spacecraft company with the ultimate goal of colonizing Mars, as well as providing satellite internet through Starlink.
- **The Boring Company**: Focused on tunnel construction and infrastructure.
- **Neuralink**: Working on technologies that could potentially cure paralysis in the near future.
- **SolarCity**: A solar energy company.
- **X.AI**: A company aimed at competing with OpenAI, the firm behind ChatGPT, which Elon co-founded but later left.
- **Twitter (now X)**: The social media platform he recently acquired.


What’s remarkable about Elon is not just the diversity of his ventures but his active involvement in each one. He’s not merely an investor—he’s hands-on with their progress. His intense work ethic extends to his employees, whom he expects to match his relentless drive.

I’ve realized that I’m strangely drawn to the charisma of men like Elon Musk and Donald Trump. Despite their flaws, their bold, uncensored way of speaking and willingness to break social norms is something I find compelling. Their ability to tell people to "fuck off" without hesitation resonates with me—though I recognize how controversial that sounds.

I also appreciate Elon’s sense of humor, which often lands him in hot water. Whether it’s his infamous tweet suggesting he wanted to impregnate Taylor Swift or his audacious question about why there haven’t been any assassination attempts on Biden/Harris, he doesn’t hold back. His unapologetic craziness fascinates me.

In my life, I often feel the need to act submissive to authority and censor the kind of jokes I can share on social media. Seeing someone as powerful as Elon defy those norms is something I admire. To be clear, I’m not advocating for anarchy, nor do I support racist, casteist, or misogynistic ideologies. Quite the opposite—I just find it frustrating that my humor must be so carefully regulated in a world where people are quick to take offense.

On the internet, Elon Musk has both avid supporters and harsh critics. His detractors often reduce him to someone born into wealth who got lucky by investing in the right companies. On the other hand, his fanboys argue that he knows everything about electric cars, spacecraft, and everything else he ventures into. As is often the case, the truth lies somewhere in the middle. According to former employees, Musk is frequently wrong and sometimes proposes outrageous ideas, but occasionally, he’s right—and when he is, his insights are something no one else had considered.

One of Musk's defining traits is his commitment to first principles thinking. Borrowing from Wikipedia, this means "decomposing things down to the fundamental axioms in a given area, then reasoning up by asking which ones are relevant to the problem at hand, cross-referencing conclusions based on the chosen axioms, and ensuring those conclusions don’t violate any fundamental laws." This approach allows him to dive into the minute details of how things like space and car companies work, even without formal expertise in those fields.

After selling his first company, which eventually became what we know today as PayPal, Musk found himself with spare cash. Instead of settling for more traditional investments, he decided to start a space company—an incredibly bold move for a private citizen with no degree in the field. He had no clear path to profitability but did it anyway. Now, SpaceX is the largest private space company, launching satellites for NASA and providing satellite internet crucial to Ukraine’s war effort against Russia. Only after SpaceX did he go on to lead Tesla, his most valuable company today.

So, is Musk successful purely because of his intelligence, or did luck play a role too? I believe Elon has worked incredibly hard, taken enormous risks, and fully deserves his success. However, it’s clear that many of those risks could have backfired—and sometimes they did, though not enough to ruin him completely. There are countless people who have worked just as hard, taken similar risks, and failed so spectacularly that no one writes books about them. So yes, Musk was lucky, but he was also aware of the risks he took, and in some cases, he took those risks even when they weren’t necessary. He absolutely deserves the rewards of those gambles.

Now, when it comes to Elon’s political views, I find it difficult to defend him. He seems to be drifting down the conspiracy rabbit hole. Musk recently endorsed Donald Trump—a man he once dismissed as a grifter—likely because a Trump presidency would grant him unchecked power and policy leverage. I think Elon knows exactly how unfit Trump is for leadership. It’s also troubling that Musk hasn’t done enough to distance himself from transphobia. In fact, he often echoes harmful, transphobic rhetoric, which is both disappointing and alarming. I worry where this path will take him, especially considering that his own father is a conspiracy theorist. I hope he doesn’t follow in his father’s footsteps.

According to Sam Altman, the current CEO of OpenAI, Musk’s ambition to “save humanity” seems conditional—only if it’s on his terms. There’s also a quote in the book that mentions how Elon cares about humanity as a concept more than individual humans. He undeniably suffers from a "superhero syndrome," feeling the need to be the one to save the world.

I’m not even sure how much of what I’m writing here I truly believe, but here goes nothing. I admire Musk’s audacity and ambition, and part of me wants to emulate his boldness. But I’m also aware that this kind of craziness can’t be artificially cultivated. I know myself—I’m naturally averse to risk, and sometimes I hate that about myself. Yet, I’m still young and just starting college, and maybe I can spend the next few years trying to live as someone unafraid to speak his mind and take risks, even if it doesn’t come naturally to me.
Well, I think that’s enough for my first blog. I’m not sure if there will be a second part, and I probably forgot a few points I wanted to include. That said, I’d love to hear your thoughts! I’m aiming to add a comment and rating feature directly under the post, but unfortunately, that’s not available just yet. In the meantime, feel free to leave your feedback in my Instagram DMs.
